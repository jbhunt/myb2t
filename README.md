This is a repository for the Python package I created for the [2025 Brain-to-Text Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/brain-to-text-25). The objective of this competition is to create a machine learning model to decode intended speech using a dataset consisting of intracranial (cortical) recordings from human participants and transcriptions of phoneme and character sequences the participant is attempting to vocalize. I implemented a muli-task learning (MTL) encoder-decoder transformer that uses a character-level language model conditioned on the neural activity to predict target phoneme and character sequences. The decoder block was pre-trained using the English OPUS (OpenSubtitles) corpus.
