This is a repository for the Python package I created for the 2025 Brain-to-Text Kaggle competition (sponsored by Blackrock Neurotech). The objective of this competition is to create a machine learning model to decode intended speech using a dataset consisting of intracranial (cortical) recordings from human participants and transcriptions of intended phoneme and character sequences. I approached this problem by implementing a muli-task learning (MTL) encoder-decoder transformer that uses a character-level language model conditioned on the neural activity to predict target phoneme and character sequences. The decoder block was pre-trained using the English-English OPUS (OpenSubtitles) corpus.
